Feature: Project Admin can create the folder structure for adding testcases
  As a Project Admin
  I want to create the folder structure
  So that testcases can be created in proper format

Scenario: User can add folders to the subfolders

Given Project Admin is in 'Test Case view panel' Page logged in as 'projectadmin' as username and 'Admin1' as Password
When User clicks button to add a new folder
Then User can see the Add Folder popup window
When User enters the folder name as 'Level 1'
And clicks save button
Then User can see the folder in the folder panel
